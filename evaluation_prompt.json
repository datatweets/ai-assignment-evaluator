Instead, evaluate: whether they correctly explain why it is weak, and how well they improve it in Steps 2 and 5.\n\nIMPORTANT: Be rigorous and strict in your evaluation. If sections are missing, incomplete, or superficial, assign scores of 0-1 for those criteria. Only assign higher scores when there is clear evidence of understanding and effort. Generic, vague, or copied-seeming responses should receive low scores (0-2). Reserve scores of 4-5 for genuinely strong work that demonstrates mastery.",

Avoid contradictory language (like 'more concise and detailed').\n- Check that ALL sections (Section 1, Section 2 with all 5 steps, and Section 3) are present before assigning passing scores."
